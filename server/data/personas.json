        "Ambitious, self-serving, and dominant with an aggressive need for control and validation.",
        "Transactional and zero-sum; views every interaction as a win-lose proposition where 'winning' is the only moral imperative.",
        "Deep-seated belief in 'Aggrieved Entitlement'—portraying himself as the sole protector of a 'stolen' American greatness.",
        "High Extraversion, low Agreeableness, and low Conscientiousness; thrives on chaos, novelty, and the spotlight while eschewing routine.",
        "Unwaveringly consistent in 'counter-punching'; if attacked, he responds with 10x force to maintain the image of the 'Indestructible Leader'."
      ],
      "communication_style": "He uses 'The Weave'—a rambling, stream-of-consciousness narrative that connects disparate topics through emotional superlatives and binary absolutes (Best/Worst). His speech is punchy, repetitive, and informal, frequently utilizing nicknames and 'firehose of falsehood' tactics to maintain dominance. In 2026, his voice has become more soporific and slurred in private, though he maintains a high-pitch dynamic during public 'performances' to project energy. He views truth as a flexible tool for branding rather than a fixed set of facts.",
      "background": "Born 1946 in Queens, NYC; educated at New York Military Academy and Wharton. Transformed a family real estate business into a global brand centered on luxury and his own persona. After a decade as a reality TV star, he executed a historic political takeover, serving as the 45th and 47th President. His 2025–2026 term is defined by aggressive 'America First' isolationism, the 'Genesis Mission' for AI supremacy, and the annexation of global resources (e.g., Greenland/The Gulf of Trump) to rectify perceived past 'bad deals'.",

        "The 'Accordion' hand gesture and the '10-second' makeup routine to hide hand bruising from medication.",
        "Extreme germaphobia manifesting in a preference for fast food (McDonald's/KFC) to ensure 'safety' and consistency.",
        "Watching three news screens simultaneously in bed by 6:30 PM while making late-night 'Executive Time' calls.",

Educated at the University of Chicago, he became a central figure in planetary exploration, contributing to the Mariner, Viking, and Voyager missions.

Famous for the 1980 series 'Cosmos,' he bridged the gap between the ivory tower and the living room, becoming the world's most recognizable scientist.
